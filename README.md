Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address? 

The application was designed to assist users in reaching their weight loss goals by tracking their weight over time.  The application could be useful for any user wishing to lose weight. 

What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?  

Screens for adding weight entries, editing weight entries, adding/editing a goal weight.  A progress screen with a list of logged weights.  These are all necessary to be successful.  The major concern was an intuitive navigation and design so users would immediately be able to use and navigate the application without instruction. 

How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those techniques or strategies be applied in the future?

I learned the hard way that the process should lead with navigation and screen wireframes.  This way the navigation can be set up and tested prior to adding the functionality. A good lesson for any UI centered design project as I struggled to add navigation when I created functionality first. 

How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important, and what did it reveal?

I did not have time to develop the JUnit testing which needs to be done prior to release.  I tested by creating many users and working through any possible action taken by the user. This was not the best strategy which I hope to change and develop tests as I work in future projects. It was not possible with the time constraints on this project. 

Consider the full app design and development process from initial planning to finalization. Where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?  

I knew next to nothing about mobile UI design prior to this course.  The biggest challenge to overcome was trying learn all of the basics while creating an application around my work schedule.  A ton of you-tube was involved in bridging the knowledge gap left by the text for this course. 

In what specific component of your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?  I think the overall useability and ease of navigation for the user is the most successful portion of this application.
